There are many ways you can get involved in developing in Ethereum ecosystem.

* Ethereum: You can work on Ethereum itself, which involves research and development (R\&D) work at the protocol level. This, in itself, is a huge effort with different areas of work coming together to create Ethereum.
* Applications: You can develop applications (like Uniswap) on top of Ethereum, which involves writing smart contract programs and a front-end to interact with those smart contracts.
* Security: Smart contracts are immutable once deployed. Once a vulnerability is deployed, it cannot be fixed by updating that smart contract code. Hence, focus on secure contracts is a big part of any dapp development.

Depending on your interests, you can follow one of the guides below.

## Application

This will guide you through learning Solidity for writing smart contracts. It will also involve:

* React: For writing front-end in Javascript.
* Hardhat: A development environment based on Javascript to compile, debug and test your dapp.

Since these applications don't require a trusted third-party, they are also called dapps (decentralized applications).

{% hint style="info" %}
Solidity, React and Hardhat is not the only way to build dapps. For example: Vyper, Vue.js and Truffle are other alternatives.

1. Do the **Solidity Path** and **Advanced Solidity Path** from [Crypto Zombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en/course/).
2. Build and deploy a basic dapp: [The complete guide to full stack ethereum development](https://dev.to/dabit3/the-complete-guide-to-full-stack-ethereum-development-3j13).
3. Scaffold-eth is a github repository containing hundreds of example branches to demonstrate different concepts. Follow [Ethereum dev speed run](https://medium.com/@austin\_48503/%EF%B8%8Fethereum-dev-speed-run-bd72bcba6a4c) to learn some Solidity concepts and then build dapps using scaffold-eth.
4. Smart contracts need to be secure. Solve these series of challenge to hack smart contracts: [https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/). There are online resources to guide you through them if you're stuck.
5. Hackathons are a great way to find a team (or hack solo) and get hands-on experience. [EthGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) conducts hackathons throughout the year. They have sponsors who have prizes for best applications using their products. They also have pool prizes which is distributed to all the submissions integrating their products in a meaningful way.
