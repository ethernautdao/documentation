This is a job offer for mentors. You either have the candidates to be mentored or you need both a mentor and a mentee. We can offer mentors a payment for the hours implemented into training. \

This option is for public goods projects in need of a mentor and projects with small funds that plan to become profitable in the future. EthernautDAO treasury can cover the costs for the mentor in both cases.

:green\_circle: Public good projects won't be charged in any way but we will appreciate mutual collaboration.&#x20;

:red\_circle: Future profitable projects will need to submit a fund request proposal and future EthernautDAO retribution, which is to be voted by the EthernautDAO council.

To apply please contact Dhannte on discord [here](https://t.co/mrWVYLM8Q1)\
