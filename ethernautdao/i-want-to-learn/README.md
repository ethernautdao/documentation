👩‍🏫 Learn how to build on Ethereum; the superpowers and the gotchas.

🎥 Watch this quick video as an [Intro to Ethereum Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlJPjJQZtC8).

Then use [🏗 Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth#-scaffold-eth) to copy/paste each Solidity concept and tinker:

[global units](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.6/units-and-global-variables.html), [primitives](https://solidity-by-example.org/primitives/), [mappings](https://solidity-by-example.org/mapping/), [structs](https://solidity-by-example.org/structs/), [modifiers](https://solidity-by-example.org/function-modifier/), [events](https://solidity-by-example.org/events/),[inheritance](https://solidity-by-example.org/inheritance/), [sending eth](https://solidity-by-example.org/sending-ether/), and [payable](https://solidity-by-example.org/payable/)/[fallback](https://solidity-by-example.org/fallback/) functions.

The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired on [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/), played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players. Do you have an interesting idea? PRs are welcome at [github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut).

Are you interested in smart contract development or security? Does securing the world’s blockchain infrastructure sound exciting to you? [**We are hiring!**](https://grnh.se/dd38880f3us)

You like the game but your language is not available? [**Contribute a translation!**](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/ethernaut/tree/master/README.md#adding-new-languages)****\
