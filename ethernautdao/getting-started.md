# Getting Started

Ready to become an Ethernaut ? Here are some steps to start your journey.

First of you need to choose what your role will be in the DAO :

* [**Mentee**](getting-started.md#mentee): You are new to the Ethereum ecosystem and want to become a developer in this space.
* [**Mentor**](getting-started.md#mentor): You are an experienced Ethereum developer and want to help others to become one.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have not yet joined our [discord](https://discord.gg/RQ5WYDxUF3), join us and present yourself in the appropriate role channel (#mentor-intros / #mentee-intros).
{% endhint %}

## Mentee

As a mentee you'll be able to apply to pairings with experienced developers in order to ramp up your skills and join the Ethereum developer ecosystem.

When a new pairing is proposed you will see it announced on the `#announcement` channel on our discord and a post should be added to the forum in the [corresponding section](https://forum.ethernautdao.io/c/pairing/6).

As Ethernaut DAO do not offer directly pairings and is a medium between mentees and mentors, pairing offers can be very different and suited to different candidates depending on the needs of the mentor. Read attentively the offer and respond to it by following the process explained in the offer.

Usually applications consist in a response post in the forum with the required information. Once the mentor have enough candidates, the application process will be closed. Selected candidates will be announced on our discord once the selection process is done.

If you are selected for a pairing (Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ ) we would love to hear from you ! If you can share some content produced during the pairing, especially if it can help others become better developers, mentees, etc, it would greatly add value to our documentation.

If you're not selected don't worry there are lot of opportunities ! In the meantime you can always work on your skills. Here are some ideas :

* Check [our resources](../educational-resources/resources.md) to improve your knowledge & skills (e.g. Solidity, EVM, ...)
* Discuss with members of the DAO on our discord to improve your understanding on different topics or share ideas about projects
* Participate to the DAO. Any help is welcomed !&#x20;
